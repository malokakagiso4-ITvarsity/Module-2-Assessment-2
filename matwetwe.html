                        <h3>MATWETWE</h3>
                        <p>On New Year's Eve, two best friends try to score a huge deal, dodge a gangster and his violent minions, get the girl, and ultimately save their lives.</p>
                        <P>This movie spans a day and night – a particular day, New Year’s Eve of 201 – in Atteridgeville. It follows the paths of Lefa and Papi, two best friends 
                        who have just finished school, and their hustle to make money from selling dagga so that Lefa has enough to enrol at Wits university.</P>
                        <p>Even though Atteridgeville is bleak and desperate, the two bumble their way through the streets, getting into all sorts of trouble, revealing their boyish
                        concerns about girls, their hopes for the future, their pasts and, and some of the strange people who live (and die) alongside them.</p>
                        <p>Both Sibusiso Khwinana (Lefa) and Tebasto Mashishi (Papi) are extraordinary. Their performances are the most interesting combination of theatrical and natural, 
                        giving them an unselfconscious sparkle that makes you fall in love with them both, even though their characters are so completely different. I love their ease with 
                        each other, their innocence and charm, their emotional depth and rawness and their physicality. These two are superstars.</p>
