                        <h3>NOBODY'S FOOL</h3>
                        <p>After serving five years in prison, wild child Tanya looks to her buttoned-up, by-the-book sister Danica to help her get back on her feet. 
                        The feisty ex-con becomes suspicious and concerned when Danica tells her that she's in a long-distance, online relationship with a mysterious 
                        man she's never seen. As the polar opposites start to collide, Tanya soon discovers that her sibling's picture-perfect life may not be what it seems.</p>
                        <P>Nobody's Fool is a 2018 American romantic comedy film written and directed by Tyler Perry. It stars Tiffany Haddish, Tika Sumpter, Omari Hardwick, 
                        Mehcad Brooks, Amber Riley and Whoopi Goldberg, and follows a recently paroled woman who tries to help her sister with a man who may be catfishing her. 
                        The film marks Tyler Perry's first R-rated comedy, as well as his first film not to be distributed by Lionsgate.</P>
                        <p>Produced by Paramount Players (as the studio's first film), Tyler Perry Studios, and BET Films, Nobody's Fool was released in the United States on November 2,
                        2018, by Paramount Pictures. It received negative reviews, but some praise for Haddish and Goldberg's performances. It grossed $33 million worldwide, making it one 
                        of Perry's lowest-grossing films.</p>
