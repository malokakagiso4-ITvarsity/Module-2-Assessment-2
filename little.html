                        <h3>LITTLE</h3>
                        <p>Jordan is a take-no-prisoners tech mogul who torments her long-suffering assistant, April, and the rest of her employees on a daily basis. 
                            She soon faces an unexpected threat to her personal life and career when she magically transforms into a 13-year-old version of herself 
                            right before a do-or-die presentation. Jordan will now need to rely on April more than ever if April is willing to stop treating Jordan 
                            like a 13-year-old child who has an attitude problem.</p>
                        <P>Little is a 2019 American fantasy comedy film directed and co-written by Tina Gordon. It stars Regina Hall, Issa Rae and Marsai Martin, 
                            and follows an overbearing boss who is transformed into the child version of herself. Martin serves as an executive producer for the film, 
                            and at 14 years old, is the youngest person to ever hold that title on a Hollywood production.</P>
                        <p>The film was released in New Haven on April 8, 2019, and it was released in the United States on April 12, 2019, by Universal Pictures, 
                            and grossed over $48 million worldwide. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances and heart but called it 
                            "a bit safer and lighter on laughs than many would like."[4] This is the last Legendary Pictures film at Universal due to production 
                            conflicts with Thomas Tull in the course of initiating the deal and making it return to Warner Bros. Pictures.</p>
