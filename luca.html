                        <h3>LUCA</h3>
                        <p>Set in a beautiful seaside town on the Italian Riviera, the original animated feature is a coming-of-age story about one young boy 
                            experiencing an unforgettable summer filled with gelato, pasta and endless scooter rides. Luca shares these adventures with his 
                            newfound best friend, but all the fun is threatened by a deeply held secret: he is a sea monster from another world just below 
                            the water's surface.</p>
                        <P>Luca is a 2021 American computer-animated coming-of-age fantasy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and distributed by Walt 
                            Disney Studios Motion Pictures. The film was directed by Enrico Casarosa (in his feature-length directorial debut), written by 
                            Jesse Andrews and Mike Jones, from a story by Casarosa, Andrews, and Simon Stephenson, produced by Andrea Warren, and starring 
                            the voices of Jacob Tremblay, Jack Dylan Grazer, Emma Berman, Saverio Raimondo, Marco Barricelli, Maya Rudolph, Jim Gaffigan, 
                            Peter Sohn, Lorenzo Crisci, Marina Massironi, and Sandy Martin.</P>
                        <p>Set on the Italian Riviera in the 1950â€“1960s, the film centers on Luca Paguro, a sea monster boy with the ability to assume human 
                            form while on land, who explores the town of Portorosso with his new best friend, Alberto Scorfano, experiencing a life-changing 
                            summer adventure. Luca takes inspiration from Casarosa's childhood in Genoa; several Pixar artists were sent to the Italian Riviera 
                            gathering research from Italian culture and environment. The sea monsters, a "metaphor for feeling different", were loosely based on 
                            old Italian regional myths and folklore. Like La Luna, the design and animation were inspired by hand-drawn and stop motion works and 
                            Hayao Miyazaki's style. Casarosa described the result as a film that "pays homage to Federico Fellini and other classic Italian filmmakers,
                            with a dash of Miyazaki in the mix too".</p>
                        <P>Luca premiered at the Aquarium of Genoa on June 13, 2021, and was originally set to be theatrically released in the United States on June 18, 2021.
                            However, in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the film was released direct-to-streaming on Disney+, along with a simultaneous limited run 
                            at the El Capitan Theatre; it was also released in theaters in countries without the streaming service. The film received positive reviews from critics, 
                            with praise for its visuals, voice performances and nostalgic feel.</P>
